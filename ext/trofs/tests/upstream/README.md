# Upstream trofs Tests (Reference Only)

These are the original upstream tcltest-based tests from trofs 0.4.9.
They are kept here for reference but may not work with our Tcl 9 patches.

**Why these may not work:**
1. `load.tcl` is generated by configure with version-specific paths
2. `trofs.test` may have version checks or assumptions specific to Tcl 8.x
3. The tcltest framework setup expects the original unpatched build

**For testing our patched trofs, use the parent directory tests:**
- `rake trofs:test` - Runs both Tcl and Ruby tests
- `rake trofs:test:tcl` - Runs `tests/test_trofs.tcl`
- `rake trofs:test:ruby` - Runs `tests/test_trofs.rb`
