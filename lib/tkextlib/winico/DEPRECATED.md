# winico Extension - REMOVED

**Status:** Removed (January 2026)

## Reason for Removal

The winico (Windows Icon) extension has been removed from this project because:

1. **Windows-only** - Not cross-platform, limited utility
2. **Abandoned upstream** - Part of the tktable sourceforge project (last release 2008)
3. **Depends on removed extension** - Required tktable/setup.rb which was removed
4. **Alpha quality** - Was marked as "possibly available (not tested)" in SUPPORT_STATUS
5. **No package manager support** - Not available in standard package managers

## Historical Reference

The original code wrapped the winico extension from:
- Project: http://sourceforge.net/projects/tktable (same project as TkTable)
- Platform: Windows only
- Purpose: Windows icon manipulation in Tk applications

If you need Windows icon functionality, consider using platform-native Ruby libraries or maintaining your own fork.
